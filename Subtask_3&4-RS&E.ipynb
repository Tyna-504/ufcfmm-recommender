    "Subtasks 3 and 4 are closely intertwined, with the former involving building the recommendation system and the latter involving evaluating its effectiveness using appropriate metrics. Performing these tasks together in one notebook allows for a more seamless and integrated approach to building and evaluating the recommendation system. This also makes it easier to keep track of the steps taken and results obtained and make any necessary changes or improvements. Additionally, since these tasks are shorter compared to Subtasks 1, 2, and 5, it makes sense to keep them together in one notebook."

    "\n",
    "For this project, we used three methods to build a recommender system: K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest Classifier, and Collaborative Filtering. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is a simple and effective method to predict user ratings based on the similarity of items. It is computationally efficient and easy to implement, making it a popular choice for recommender systems. Random Forest Classifier (RFC) is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can handle large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces. It works by creating multiple decision trees and combining their predictions to make a final recommendation. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a technique that recommends items to users based on similar users preferences. CF is very effective in many recommendation scenarios and is particularly useful when dealing with sparse data. By combining these three methods, we aim to build a comprehensive and accurate recommender system that can provide users with personalised recommendations based on their past behaviour and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training and Testing the Models ###\n",
    "To train the model, we will select features such as product price and review score and use the target variable of the product ID as the prediction output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we will create models using KNeighborsClassifier and RandomForestClassifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommender system to ensure that it is performing well and providing accurate recommendations to users. The metrics such as precision, recall, f1, etc., are commonly used to evaluate the performance of recommendation systems.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the choice of evaluation metric should depend on the specific goals of the recommendation system and the type of data being used. "

By training the model on selected features and target variables, we can create clusters of similar customers. However, to improve the accuracy and precision of the KNN model, we can use techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical data, scaling variables to normalize their values and remove bias, and grid search to determine the best K value for KNN. By applying these techniques and including more parameters for a given product, we improved our model's precision to 87%. Next, we will look at RFC."

The model works by identifying patterns in customer orders and recommending products to customers based on the previous customers' orders. By inputting a customer ID into the model, the output is a list of recommended products for the user. Our model's success is indicated by the list of recommended product IDs, which correctly recommend similar products to the customers' previous purchases. Overall, the Collaborative Filtering model was a useful tool for providing personalised recommendations to customers, which could improve their shopping experience and boost sales."

The benefits of KNN with means include its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to handle large datasets with high sparsity. Additionally, KNN with means is highly interpretable, as the recommendations it provides are based on the ratings of similar users.\n",

Using the price parameter we achieved a RMSE of 0.025, but adding the review score as well (using feature engineering) we managed to improve the RMSE to 0.021. We have managed to improve the prediction accuracy of the product recommendations to a high level of prediction accuracy.
