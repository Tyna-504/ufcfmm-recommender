Instructions:
The Subtasks are split over several files, appropriately named: Subtask-1-EDA.ipynb, Subtask-2-CS.ipynb, Subtask-3&4-R&E.ipynb, Subtask-5-SA.ipynb.
Please note the introduction to the report is in Subtask 1 (as it is the first file), and the overall conclusion is in Subtask 5 (as it is the last file).
Each file contains Table of Contents at the beginning, with clickable links to each chapter. Similarly, each chapter ends with a clickable link to take you back to the Contents. Make use of these links for easier navigation.
